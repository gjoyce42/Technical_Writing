# Research Log
## Week 1:

I am Greg Joyce and this is my Weekly Research Log for English 235 - Technical Writing.
So far this week, we have learned how to create repositories, add files to repositories,
clone branches from masters, commit changes, and start/accept pull requests in GitHub.

The most significant thing I can say about GitHub is that is is a collaboration centered
platform. Everything I have done so far has been a solitary excercise; however, it is 
clear that this system is designed for me to share this work and/or invite others to 
work on projects with me.
