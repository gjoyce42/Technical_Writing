# Research Log
## Week 1:
----------

I am Greg Joyce and this is my Weekly Research Log for English 235 - Technical Writing.
So far this week, we have learned how to:

### Create repositories
-----------------------
1. add files to repositories
2. clone branches from masters
3. commit changes
4. start/accept pull requests
### Format
----------
1. bullet lists
2. headings
3. lists
 
 
The most significant thing I can say about GitHub is that is is a collaboration centered platform.
Everything I have done so far has been a solitary excercise; however, it is clear that this system
is designed for me to share this work and/or invite others to work on projects with me. 

The readings lined up pretty well with what I was expecting. I imagined writing directions/instructions
and troubleshooting guides. The PierceHacker is clearly for an audience of Pierce College students.
As for the programming historian, I feel the intended audience is the self-improving programming
novice. There is some high level and also some low level difficulty topics there so it seems like
a good place for someone to develop their understanding continually. I think these were posted on
public sites to encourage collaboration, participation, and to help grow the community that started
the projects.

## Week 2:
----------
This week, we are making a more complicated lego design by adding 5-10 pieces. Since I missed the original 
design project last week, I decided to start with a 20 piece design. To make sure I could replicate the 
design, I first took a picture of the finished project and then started to take it apart in chunks (taking
pictures at each step). I then took each chunk apart, taking pictures at each step. Finally, I took a
picture of all the pieces layed out in an organized way. My next step is writing out instructions for each
step.

For reference, I looked up some lego instruction guides to see how the professionals do it. One thing I 
noticed is there are no words! They are just a series of pictures with arrows. I'm glad I took good
pictures (I think) because that seems to be important. I will consider adding arrows but I feel like 
written instructions should suffice.

Today (Wednesday) I wrote out all the instructions in a google doc. I think it will come out best with words
on one side and pictures on the other. 

By Thursday, I had the instructions complete with words in the left column and pictures in the right. I
was trying to print a pdf that would fold like a book but I couldn't get it to print. I later realized that
the pages were in the wrong order for a folded pamphlet but worked ok as a digital file. That file was,
however a little difficult to read for one person. I think a pdf was the right file format and just required
some different arrangement for the digital version vs the printable version. I thought this format was best 
because I could finely tune the placement of pictures and text if necessary as well as combine multiple pages
and reorder them.

Overall I was reminded that creating step-by-step procedures for anything is an iterative process. The first
version is never the best version and it takes research, collaboration, and a willingness to throw anything
out the window when it stops working. I also learned that some people have a hard time understanding what is
happening in a picture.
