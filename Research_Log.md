# Research Log
## Week 1:
----------

I am Greg Joyce and this is my Weekly Research Log for English 235 - Technical Writing.
So far this week, we have learned how to:

### Create repositories
-----------------------
1. add files to repositories
2. clone branches from masters
3. commit changes
4. start/accept pull requests
### Format
----------
1. bullet lists
2. headings
3. lists
 
 
The most significant thing I can say about GitHub is that is is a collaboration centered platform.
Everything I have done so far has been a solitary excercise; however, it is clear that this system
is designed for me to share this work and/or invite others to work on projects with me. 

The readings lined up pretty well with what I was expecting. I imagined writing directions/instructions
and troubleshooting guides. The PierceHacker is clearly for an audience of Pierce College students.
As for the programming historian, I feel the intended audience is the self-improving programming
novice. There is some high level and also some low level difficulty topics there so it seems like
a good place for someone to develop their understanding continually. I think these were posted on
public sites to encourage collaboration, participation, and to help grow the community that started
the projects.


## Week 2:
----------
This week, we are making a more complicated lego design by adding 5-10 pieces. Since I missed the original 
design project last week, I decided to start with a 20 piece design. To make sure I could replicate the 
design, I first took a picture of the finished project and then started to take it apart in chunks (taking
pictures at each step). I then took each chunk apart, taking pictures at each step. Finally, I took a
picture of all the pieces layed out in an organized way. My next step is writing out instructions for each
step.

For reference, I looked up some lego instruction guides to see how the professionals do it. One thing I 
noticed is there are no words! They are just a series of pictures with arrows. I'm glad I took good
pictures (I think) because that seems to be important. I will consider adding arrows but I feel like 
written instructions should suffice.

Today (Wednesday) I wrote out all the instructions in a google doc. I think it will come out best with words
on one side and pictures on the other. 

By Thursday, I had the instructions complete with words in the left column and pictures in the right. I
was trying to print a pdf that would fold like a book but I couldn't get it to print. I later realized that
the pages were in the wrong order for a folded pamphlet but worked ok as a digital file. That file was,
however a little difficult to read for one person. I think a pdf was the right file format and just required
some different arrangement for the digital version vs the printable version. I thought this format was best 
because I could finely tune the placement of pictures and text if necessary as well as combine multiple pages
and reorder them.

Overall I was reminded that creating step-by-step procedures for anything is an iterative process. The first
version is never the best version and it takes research, collaboration, and a willingness to throw anything
out the window when it stops working. I also learned that some people have a hard time understanding what is
happening in a picture.


## Week 3:
----------
### Composing the Survey
<p>This week, we collaborated in a small group to compose survey questions. The goal of the survey is to inform
our future work creating tutorials/user help files. I thought it was interesting how we all saw different 
things as important when asking a question. I was very focussed on making the questions accessible and easy
to answer based on my prior experience analyzing survey data working for McDonald's and my work in the 
tutoring center making documents accessible. Another member of my group seemed to be planning his tutorial and 
trying to ask the questions that would allow him to do so. Someone else was focussed on making sure we knew
what programs, operating systems, and devices students use so our tutorials would be the most helpful. At
first collaboration was a little tough with multiple strong personalities trying to work together but I feel
like we found ways to compromise & form consensus and ended up with some good questions.
</p>

### Revisiting Week 1
<p>When I imagine the Pierce Hacker audience, I see two basic groups:

The first group is the returning student. It can be very difficult to relearn how school works and you have 
to do it fast to be successful. Many students at Pierce were never asked to use technology to submit and 
manage assignments and some areuncomfortable with computers in general. If we can make it easier for these 
folks to jump that hurdle, they have a much better chance of overcoming their academic hurdles.
</p>

<p>The second group is students who struggled in high school or other school. Pierce Hacker can help these
students be successful by providing a resource designed specifically for them. These students will thrive
best if they are provided support and encouragement - creating this platform will provide that.
</p>

<p>I think the work we are being asked to do is provided on a public website so that it can have a lasting
effect for our audience and also to empower us to engage with these media for our own benefit.
</p>

### What I learned
This week, I learned how to better form a survey. By using concise, clear language and providing the survey
taker just the right amount of choices to answer with we can get useful data. I also learned that some
people choose **_not_** to take Math classes and may never use WAMAP. Seriously, though, it is hard for me
to imagine that some students avoid STEM classes and I need to keep that front of mind. I am also getting better
with markdown which was one of my personal learning outcomes for this course.


## Week 4:
----------
### Preparing to Write an Analytical Report
This week was short (3 days of class instead of 5). We focussed on finishing up our survey and did some research
on compiling analytical reports.
#### Here are my key take-aways:
- The report should be interesting and easy to read.
- Cover Pages are for asthetics, Title Pages tell you what it's all about.
- The Memo of Transmittal is like the email you would attach a report to. It references the request for said
  report and what has been discussed in advance as well as the intent of the report and an expression of gratitude.
- The findings should be discussed in detail and also summarized for quick reference.
- Any surveys or data that is referenced should be included or a link to it should be provided.

That's all I have for this week. I look forward to analyzing some data and writing my first analytical report!


## Week 5:
----------
### The Process of Drafting Our Report
Greg and I have been collaborating on an analytical report. Our process started with reading the assignment and
also a couple analytical reports we found online. As we were doing this, Greg started a Google Doc for us and
started the cover and title pages. We then read through the survey results and decided a few things we thought
were interesting enough to write about. I started up a table of contents so we had an framework to start with
which made splitting up the work easier.

### Feedback Received
We heard back that the organization and formatting of the report was nice and that overall it looked good. I was
stuck in traffic so I didn't get a chance to ask any further questions but Greg tells me we didn't get any 
suggestions or recomemndations for changes/adittions.

### Plans for Finalization
Since the formatting seems good, we will continue fleshing out our sections. I will finish our letter of
transmittal and conclusions/recommendations and Greg will do take care of the executive summary and appendices.

### What I learned
I learned that often times most of the writing you do goes unread. That means summaries are especially important
in content and clarity. I will continue to think about what else I have learned and add on as appropriate.


## Week 8:
_____
### Thoughts on the OER
If I were to choose this course, I would probably write a chapter about grant proposals. This is the kind of technical writing I will have to do in the future. It is also the only kind of technical writing that I was hoping to get out of this class. I don't want to work on this, however, as I do not value textbooks as learning tools in the modern age. It would be hard for me to imagine anyone being happy to have read my work and so almost impossible to motivate myself to do it.

### Thoughts on PierceHacker
Continuing to work on PierceHacker is a welcome prospect. I feel like I have spent a good amount of time thinking about this project and have built up some investment in it. I think I could contribute something meaningful to it that will help others.

The biggest difference I noticed between PierceHacker and The Programming Historian is that PierceHacker does not have a wealth of contributor resources. I think the project would benefit greatly from a good set of guidelines for created/editing/reviewing content. I would like to make a tutorial that includes some resources for prospective contributors as well as a to serve as an example.

### Thoughts on Designing My Own Project
I can't think of anything I would want to do on my own. This late in the quarter, I think it would be more productive to do something that builds on what I have already learned to kind of tie it all together. Since I don't plan to use markdown or create a tutorial any time soon, it would be good to work in this space a little more to cement my learning and come to a place of understanding that goes beyond the one project I have worked on.
