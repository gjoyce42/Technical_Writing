# Research Log
## Week 1:

I am Greg Joyce and this is my Weekly Research Log for English 235 - Technical Writing.
So far this week, we have learned how to:

### Create repositories
-----------------------
1. add files to repositories
2. clone branches from masters
3. commit changes
4. start/accept pull requests
### Format
----------
1. bullet lists
2. headings
3. lists
 
 
The most significant thing I can say about GitHub is that is is a collaboration centered
platform. Everything I have done so far has been a solitary excercise; however, it is 
clear that this system is designed for me to share this work and/or invite others to 
work on projects with me. 

The readings lined up pretty well with what I was expecting. I imagined writing directions/instructions
and troubleshooting guides. The PierceHacker is clearly for an audience of Pierce College students.
As for the programming historian, I feel the intended audience is the self-improving programming
novice. There is some high level and also some low level difficulty topics there so it seems like
a good place for someone to develop their understanding continually. I think these were posted on
public sites to encourage collaboration, participation, and to help grow the community that started
the projects.
