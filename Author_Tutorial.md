## Overview
PierceHacker provides tutorials and other resources in order to help the Pierce College community develop new technical skills and better understand the ways in which technology shapes the work we do both in and out of the classroom.
## Lesson Steps/Components

### 1. Know your purpose, define outcomes
Before you begin your lesson, make sure you have a clear idea of what it will be about. Lessons should have 2-3 learning outcomes; if you have more than this consider splitting your lesson into 2 or 3 smaller lessons. In summary:
* **Clearly define 2-3 learning outcomes**
* **Shorten longer lessons or split them into smaller ones**

### 2. Understand and consider your audience
Your lesson may be for someone who has never used a certain program before or it may be for more advanced users. Make sure you have your audience clearly in mind when writing steps and make sure you keep a consistent voice. Over/under explaining some steps may be confusing for your readers. If you do want to include a note for advanced users, make it clear who that note is for. In summary:

* **Decide if your tutorial is for a novice, intermediate, or advanced user**
* **Address this user with each step - don't over/under explain**

### 3. Determine what the user will need
Remember that not everyone has a computer, or your operating system, or your web browser, etc. Think about what is absolutely required for your lesson and what you would recommend

### 4. Start drafting


### 5. Review your work and make edits
